Risks in using Thread Pools

Deadlock : While deadlock can occur in any multi-threaded program, thread pools introduce another case of deadlock, one in which all the executing threads are waiting for the results from the blocked threads waiting in the queue due to the unavailability of threads for execution.
Thread Leakage :Thread Leakage occurs if a thread is removed from the pool to execute a task but not returned to it when the task completed. As an example, if the thread throws an exception and pool class does not catch this exception, then the thread will simply exit, reducing the size of the thread pool by one. If this repeats many times, then the pool would eventually become empty and no threads would be available to execute other requests.
Resource Thrashing :If the thread pool size is very large then time is wasted in context switching between threads. Having more threads than the optimal number may cause starvation problem leading to resource thrashing as explained.
Important Points

Donâ€™t queue tasks that concurrently wait for results from other tasks. This can lead to a situation of deadlock as described above.
Be careful while using threads for a long lived operation. It might result in the thread waiting forever and would eventually lead to resource leakage.
The Thread Pool has to be ended explicitly at the end. If this is not done, then the program goes on executing and never ends. Call shutdown() on the pool to end the executor. If you try to send another task to the executor after shutdown, it will throw a RejectedExecutionException.
One needs to understand the tasks to effectively tune the thread pool. If the tasks are very contrasting then it makes sense to use different thread pools for different types of tasks so as to tune them properly.
Tuning Thread Pool

The optimum size of the thread pool depends on the number of processors available and the nature of the tasks. On a N processor system for a queue of only computation type processes, a maximum thread pool size of N or N+1 will achieve the maximum efficiency.But tasks may wait for I/O and in such a case we take into account the ratio of waiting time(W) and service time(S) for a request; resulting in a maximum pool size of N*(1+ W/S) for maximum efficiency.
The thread pool is a useful tool for organizing server applications. It is quite straightforward in concept, but there are several issues to watch for when implementing and using one, such as deadlock, resource thrashing. Use of executor service makes it easier to implement.
